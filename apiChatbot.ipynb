            "3.  **Problem-Solve:** Identify issues and find effective solutions.\n",
            "4.  **Perceive:** Understand the world around them through senses (like interpreting images or sounds).\n",
            "5.  **Interact:** Understand and use human language (like chatbots or translation services).\n",

            "*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses complex algorithms called artificial neural networks (inspired by the human brain's structure) to process data and learn intricate patterns. It excels at tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.\n",
            "*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (both spoken and written). Think Siri, Alexa, Google Translate, or ChatGPT.\n",
            "*   **Computer Vision:** Enables machines to \"see\" and interpret visual information from images or videos. Used in facial recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging analysis.\n",

Examples include virtual assistants, image recognition software, recommendation engines (like Netflix or Amazon), and self-driving car components. It can perform its specific task extremely well, often better than humans, but it can't operate outside its designated domain.\n",
            "2.  **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI or Strong AI):** This is a *hypothetical* type of AI that would possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks at a human level. It could reason, plan, solve problems abstractly, learn quickly, and learn from experience much like a human being. We are not close to achieving AGI yet.\n",
